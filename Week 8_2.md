## ANTH 641 Week 8 Exercise 2 – Using R with data from outside sources 

For your final project you’ll be gathering data from archives or published sources. You then may want to bring those data into R to perform some analyses on them. This exercise will give you some experience going through the whole process of gathering data from Open Context and doing something with it in R. We have a research question about the glass found at the site of Etruscan site of Poggio Civitate: were different types of glass objects deposited in different parts of the site? If so, what can this tell us about the use of those areas and the people who experienced and passed through those spaces?
