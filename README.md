# ANTH 641 Week 8
This week's assignments take place in RStudio. You can either run RStudio on your own computer (you can download it [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)) or you can run it in your browser with mybinder. 

Before you get started on the assignments, make sure to fork this repo so that you can upload and edit files. 

There are two exercises this week; the first exercise is completed by following instructions on a Rscript file found in this repo (ANTH 641 - Week8_1), the second exercise includes instructions in a .md file also in this repo.
